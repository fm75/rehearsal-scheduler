# How to Enter Rehearsal Constraints

When filling out your availability, you can specify times when you **cannot** attend rehearsals. This guide shows you the different ways to enter these constraints.

## Constraint Types

You can enter multiple constraints separated by commas. Each constraint can be one of these types:

### 1. Unavailable for an Entire Day

If you can't attend rehearsals on a particular day of the week, just enter the day name.

**Examples:**
- `Monday` - unavailable all day Monday
- `W` - unavailable all day Wednesday (abbreviations work!)
- `Fri` - unavailable all day Friday

**Accepted day abbreviations:**
- Monday: `Monday`, `Mon`, `Mo`, `M`
- Tuesday: `Tuesday`, `Tues`, `Tu`
- Wednesday: `Wednesday`, `Wed`, `We`, `W`
- Thursday: `Thursday`, `Thurs`, `Th`
- Friday: `Friday`, `Fri`, `Fr`, `F`
- Saturday: `Saturday`, `Sat`, `Sa`
- Sunday: `Sunday`, `Sun`, `Su`

---

### 2. Unavailable Before a Certain Time

If you can't attend rehearsals before a specific time on a particular day.

**Examples:**
- `Monday before 6 PM` - unavailable Monday before 6 PM
- `W before 5:30 PM` - unavailable Wednesday before 5:30 PM
- `Th until 7 PM` - unavailable Thursday until 7 PM (same as "before")

---

### 3. Unavailable After a Certain Time

If you can't attend rehearsals after a specific time on a particular day.

**Examples:**
- `Tuesday after 9 PM` - unavailable Tuesday after 9 PM
- `F after 8:30 PM` - unavailable Friday after 8:30 PM
- `Wed after 10 PM` - unavailable Wednesday after 10 PM

---

### 4. Unavailable During a Time Range

If you can't attend during a specific time window on a particular day.

**Examples:**
- `Thursday 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM` - unavailable Thursday from noon to 2 PM
- `M 5:00 PM - 7:30 PM` - unavailable Monday from 5 to 7:30 PM
- `Tue 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM` - unavailable Tuesday from 1 to 3 PM

---

### 5. Unavailable on a Specific Date

If you can't attend on a particular date (vacation, appointment, etc.).

**Important:** You **must** include the year!

**Accepted formats:**
- `Jan 20 26` - unavailable January 20, 2026
- `1/20/26` - same date (month/day/year)
- `Feb 15 2026` - February 15, 2026 (4-digit year also works)
- `3/10/2026` - March 10, 2026

**Accepted month abbreviations:**
- `Jan`, `Feb`, `Mar`, `Apr`, `May`, `Jun`, `Jul`, `Aug`, `Sep`, `Oct`, `Nov`, `Dec`

---
### 6. Unavailable on a Specific Date and Time

For one-time conflicts on specific dates (e.g., doctor appointment, wedding):

**Examples:**
- `Jan 15 2026 after 2pm` - Unavailable after 2pm on January 15, 2026
- `Feb 20 2026 before 11am` - Unavailable before 11am on February 20
- `Mar 5 2026 1pm-3pm` - Unavailable from 1-3pm on March 5


**Notes**
- Year is required
- Works exactly like day-of-week constraints but for one specific date
- Only applies if a rehearsal falls on that date

### 7. Unavailable for a Date Range

If you can't attend during multiple consecutive dates (vacation, travel, etc.).

**Examples:**
- `Dec 20 25 - Dec 28 25` - unavailable December 20-28, 2025
- `1/15/26 - 1/22/26` - unavailable January 15-22, 2026
- `Mar 1 26 - Mar 7 26` - unavailable March 1-7, 2026

---

## Combining Multiple Constraints

Separate multiple constraints with commas.

**Examples:**
- `Monday, Thursday after 8 PM` - unavailable all day Monday AND after 8 PM Thursday
- `W before 6 PM, Jan 15 26` - unavailable before 6 PM on Wednesdays AND all day January 15, 2026
- `Tue 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM, F, Dec 20 25 - Dec 28 25` - unavailable Tuesday 5-7 PM, all day Friday, AND December 20-28, 2025

---

## Time Format Rules

**You can write times in different ways:**
- `6 PM` or `6PM` (with or without space before PM)
- `6:30 PM` (include minutes with a colon)
- `18:30` (24-hour military time - no AM/PM needed)
- `1800` (24-hour without colon also works)

**Times without AM/PM:**
- Hours 1-7 and 12 are assumed to be **PM** (afternoon/evening rehearsal times)
- Hours 8-11 are assumed to be **AM** 
- If you mean 8 PM, write `8 PM` explicitly!

**For clarity, we recommend always including AM or PM!**

## Common Examples

**Work schedule:**
```
Monday before 5 PM, Wednesday before 5 PM, Friday before 5 PM
```

**Evening class:**
```
Thursday 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM
```

**Weekend family commitments:**
```
Saturday, Sunday before 2 PM
```

**Winter vacation:**
```
Dec 23 25 - Jan 2 26
```

**Mixed constraints:**
```
Tuesday after 9 PM, Thursday 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM, Feb 14 26
```

## What to Avoid

**❌ Don't write dates without years:**
- ~~`Jan 20`~~ → Use `Jan 20 26`
- ~~`3/15`~~ → Use `3/15/26`

**❌ Don't use ambiguous date formats:**
- ~~`Jan 20, 2026`~~ (comma creates problems) → Use `Jan 20 2026`

**❌ Don't write time ranges backwards:**
- ~~`5 PM - 2 PM`~~ → End time must be after start time
